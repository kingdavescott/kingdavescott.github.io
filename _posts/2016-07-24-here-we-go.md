I’ve wanted to start a blog for a while now…

I’m obsessed with deriving knowledge from and finding patterns in data. I have an MA in Economics and have spent the last 5 years working in various corporate analytics roles. I’m currently based in Seattle, WA.

My professional goal is to become a practicing data scientist. I’m currently taking the self-study route: reading books, taking online classes and working on side projects. This blog is primarily intended to be a repository of those side projects along with anything else I think is interesting.

Thanks for reading!
